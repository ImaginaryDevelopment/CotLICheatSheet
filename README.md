Mission Tags Cheat Sheet - Crusaders of the Lost Idols
==================

A lot of things that don't like clickable are, and many things if you hover your mouse over give tooltips.
you can click on a tag to filter crusaders on having that tag.
the numbers at the top are how many crusaders have the tag
you can click the mine checkbox to have it allow you to click which crusaders you have
and it will save that in your browser storage locally, or you can get a code at the bottom of the page to use from anywhere
mouse over any event tag, and it will show you what month/event that crusader is from =)
the number on the left side of a crusader is what slot they are in, and on the right is the total of how many tags that crusader has
